# Defender XDR - my cheat sheet
## Interesting advanced hunting queries with CloudAppEvents table
- Admins accessing emails? Which emails üìß?
```
CloudAppEvents
| where ActionType == "AdminMailAccess"
| extend extProperties = parse_json(parse_json(RawEventData)).ExtendedProperties
| mv-apply extProperties on (
    where tostring(extProperties.Name) == "InternetMessageId" | project InternetMessageId = url_decode(tostring(extProperties.Value))
  ) // extract the internetMessageId from MDCA data
| join EmailEvents on InternetMessageId // provides more details about the email accessed, including subject, sender, recipient
| join (IdentityInfo | distinct AccountUpn, AccountDisplayName, EmailAddress, JobTitle, Department) on $left.RecipientEmailAddress == $right.EmailAddress // provide more organization details including JobTitle about the Recipient the admin has accessed email 
| project Timestamp, ActionType, InternetMessageId, AdminName = AccountDisplayName, 
SenderFromAddress, RecipientEmailAddress, Subject, JobTitle, Department, ReportId
```

- Admins releasing messages from quarantine? which admins üëÆ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è and which emails?
```
CloudAppEvents 
| where ActionType == "QuarantineReleaseMessage"
| project Timestamp, AccountDisplayName, ActionType, NetworkMessageId=tostring(RawEventData.NetworkMessageId)
| join EmailPostDeliveryEvents on NetworkMessageId //join with audit log from MDO
| join EmailEvents on NetworkMessageId //add data from MDO email data, in order to provide more details about the message released
| project Timestamp, ActionType, AdminName = AccountDisplayName, SenderFromAddress, RecipientEmailAddress, Subject, 
DeliveryAction, LatestDeliveryAction, LatestDeliveryLocation, ThreatTypes1, ReportId
```

## Interesting advanced hunting queries focusing on non-human identities (SPNs / OAuth apps / workload identities)
- List/Visualize SPNs with activities in Exchange Online
let spns = (AADSpnSignInEventsBeta
| project ApplicationId, Application
| distinct ApplicationId, Application);
CloudAppEvents
| where AccountId in (spns)
| where Application == "Microsoft Exchange Online" //comment or change resource to monitor (Microsoft Azure, Microsoft 365, Microsoft SharePoint Online, Microsoft Power BI)
| join kind=inner spns on $left.AccountId == $right.ApplicationId
| summarize Count = count() by SPN=Application1, ActionType, Application, bin(Timestamp, 1d)
| order by SPN, Timestamp asc
//| project SPN, ActionType, Count | render columnchart //uncomment if you want a columnchart

- Logon spikes for SPNs, compared to baseline? Maybe something unusual is happening...üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

let interval = 12h;

| extend SpikeScore = todouble(score[FlagIndex]) // This will get the specific score associated with the detected spike
| summarize MaxScore = max(SpikeScore) by Application
| top 5 by MaxScore desc
| join kind=rightsemi AADSpnSignInEventsBeta on Application
| summarize count() by Application, bin(Timestamp, interval)
| render timechart
